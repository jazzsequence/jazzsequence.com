Instead of "Hello Dolly", this plugin will display a random lyric from David Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust".

== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation-- okay, yeah, it's just a plugin. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Ziggy Stardust</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.  All thanks goes to [Matt](http://ma.tt) for actually writing the plugin, and [David Bowie](http://www.davidbowie.com) for being Ziggy Stardust. Yes, this is just a fork of [Hello Dolly](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hello-dolly/).
