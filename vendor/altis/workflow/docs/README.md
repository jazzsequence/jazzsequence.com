# Workflow

![](./assets/banner-workflow.png)

Workflows provides teams with the flexibility to automate common tasks, enforcing quality standards and communicating more effectively by integrating notifications and actions with existing tools.

## Notifications

Notifications fill in the gaps between events happening and informing those who need to take any subsequent actions. [Find out more about how to create custom notifications and integrations](notifications.md).

## Editorial comments

[Editorial comments](editorial-comments.md) allow content creators to discuss and track the progress of their work as well as assign a piece of content to someone else.

## Built-in notifications

Some common workflow scenarios including a publishing approval workflow are provided by default but you can disable them as necessary if your needs are more complex.

[You can find more details about the default workflows here](built-in-notifications.md).
