# Optimize

Optimize is Google's A/B and multivariate testing tool. It's simple to integrate via Tag Manager.

From the [Optimize app](https://optimize.google.com/optimize/home/) you will be asked to create a new container and connect your Google Analytics account.

In GTM follow these steps:

1. Create a new tag of type "Google Optimize"
2. Enter the container ID you got when setting up Optimize
3. Select you Google Analytics Settings variable in the "Google Analytics Settings" field
4. Add a trigger for the tag to fire on all pages
4. Publish the tag!

You're now ready to start creating content tests.
