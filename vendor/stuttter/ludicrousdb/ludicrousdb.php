 *
 * LudicrousDB is a Drop-in plugin, and must be included extremely early in
 * WordPress, specifically before the database connection happens.
 *
 * The bit of code below prevents LudicrousDB from obliterating any existing
 * database connections. This is by design, to keep your site safe.
 *
 * Look at /drop-ins/db.php for more info.
