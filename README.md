## Workflow

* `dev` is the default branch.
* New features branch off `dev` or are pushed straight to `dev`.
* `main` is the production branch.
* When a release is ready, `dev` merges into `main`.
* `main` auto-deploys to production.
* ðŸŽ‰

<!-- TODO -->
<!--
* Move my plugins that are composerized to packagist so I don't need to use them as composer repositories
* composerize plugins that arne't already so we can move them to packagist
* move the deploy workflow off of DeployHQ and onto GitHub Actions
* change the dashboard "home" link to point back to the regular dashboard rather than the altis dashboard
