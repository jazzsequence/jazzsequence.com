<!-- TODO -->
<!--
* Move my plugins that are composerized to packagist so I don't need to use them as composer repositories
* composerize plugins that arne't already so we can move them to packagist
* move the deploy workflow off of DeployHQ and onto GitHub Actions
* change the dashboard "home" link to point back to the regular dashboard rather than the altis dashboard
* use a pantheon sandbox to test the actual site before deploying to production
